Factory Method Implementation Variants
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 1: Java 8 Interface Features
------------------------------------
In this example, we can see how to use static methods and default implementations
(introduced by Java 8) to realize creation methods and factory methods.

Also note that we have used an interface constant to hold a reference to the
implementation class instance (minimal Singleton implementation).
